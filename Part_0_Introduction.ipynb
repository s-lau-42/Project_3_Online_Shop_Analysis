    "In this Data Science project I will analyze the data given by an Online Shop, containing some data of customers and sales for about one and a half years. The goal is to find results and means that could be used by the owners of this shop to further their sales and profit. The steps to achieve this include the construction of new data from the given and using clustering and prediction methods. <br>\n",

    "As a note: The data provided was heavily cut and anonymized before it was provided for this project. Also the webshop has an option to buy articles without signing in with an account. All of these purchases are missing in this set of data. Hence we sadly have to take all results with not a grain but a handful of salt.\n",
